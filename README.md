# Data
Make sure you have your market basket data in a suitable format. You can place your data file in the data/ directory, or specify the data file path in the configuration (see Configuration).
# Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis

# Configuration
You can customize the analysis and behavior of the code using the configuration file config.json. Here's an example configuration file:

json
Copy code
{
  "data_file": "data/market_basket_data.csv",
  "output_dir": "results/",
  "min_support": 0.02,
  "min_confidence": 0.3,
  "min_lift": 1.0
}
data_file: Path to your market basket data file.
output_dir: Directory to store the analysis results.
min_support: Minimum support threshold for frequent itemsets.
min_confidence: Minimum confidence threshold for association rules.
min_lift: Minimum lift threshold for association rules.
Adjust these parameters according to your specific data and analysis requirements.

# Results
The analysis results will be saved in the results/ directory, including frequent itemsets and association rules. You can access these results to gain insights into your market basket data.

#  Brief Description
The market basket dataset used in this project contains [describe the data content]. This dataset is typically used for market basket analysis, which is a technique to discover associations and patterns in customer purchasing behavior. Each record in the dataset represents a transaction, and the items purchased in each transaction are recorded.

Example Fields:
Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
Date: The date of the transaction.
Items: A list of items purchased in the transaction.
Market basket analysis aims to answer questions such as:

"What items are frequently purchased together?"
"Are there any patterns or associations in customer buying habits?"
"Can we make product recommendations based on these associations?"
The results of the analysis are generated to provide insights into customer behavior and to support decision-making for inventory management, product placement, and marketing strategies.
